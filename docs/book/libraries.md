# Libraries

The protomask library suite is a collection of libraries that were originally developed for use in the protomask tool suite, but are also quite useful outside of the scope of this project.

These libraries are thoroughly documented in their respective docs.rs crate pages:

- [`easy-tun`: A minimal TUN interface library](https://docs.rs/easy-tun)
- [`fast-nat`: A library designed for highly efficient mapping and lookup of IP address pairs](https://docs.rs/fast-nat)
- [`interproto`: A library for translating packets between protocols](https://docs.rs/interproto)
- [`rfc6052`: A Rust implementation of RFC6052](https://docs.rs/rfc6052)
- [`rtnl`: A high-level wrapper around `rtnetlink`](https://docs.rs/rtnl)
